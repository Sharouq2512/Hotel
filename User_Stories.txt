User Stories (Hotel Management System)
1. Definition of User Stories and Their Format

A user story is a simple, concise description of a software feature from the perspective of the end user. It focuses on what the user wants to achieve and why it is important, rather than how the feature will be implemented.

The standard format of a user story is:

“As a [type of user], I want [some feature] so that [some benefit].”

For example:

"As a guest, I want to book a room online so that I can confirm my stay before arriving at the hotel."

User stories help the development team understand the user’s needs and prioritize features based on business value and user impact.

2. How to Write Effective User Stories

Effective user stories should follow these principles:

Independent: Each story should be self-contained and not dependent on others.

Negotiable: Stories are not contracts; details can be discussed and refined.

Valuable: Every story should deliver value to the user or business.

Estimable: The development team should be able to estimate the effort required to implement the story.

Small: Stories should be small enough to be completed within a single sprint.

Testable: Acceptance criteria must be clear so that the story can be verified as complete.

3. Acceptance Criteria and Their Importance

Acceptance criteria define the conditions that must be met for a user story to be considered complete and acceptable. They provide:

Clear instructions for developers on what to implement

A basis for testing and validation

Agreement between stakeholders and developers on expected functionality

For example, for the story: "As a guest, I want to book a room online so that I can confirm my stay," acceptance criteria could include:

The guest can select check-in and check-out dates.

The system shows available rooms and prices.

Booking confirmation is sent via email.

Double booking of the same room is prevented.
